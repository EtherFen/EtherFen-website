Outside the heart, there is no independent object in the world. EtherFen is built on blockchain technology and exists based on community consensus. We are not the first to use a blockchain application, but it must be the first blockchain application that combines Oriental religious culture.

The traditional cybergrave is facing the risk of the disappearance of the site's collapsed tomb.
